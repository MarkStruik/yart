going over the tutorial for creating a roguelike in python http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/


## start running the code

If you have python installed locally you can just get all the code and run 
```
python main.py
```

### using a dev container

If you editor of choice is VSCode and you have docker installed, you can use the devcontainer that is configured. 
Once it is running you can open a browser and view the linux x11 fluxbox through: http://localhost:6080/
pwd => vscode
